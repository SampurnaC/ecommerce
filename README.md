# Ecommerce Application

## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:SampurnaC/ecommerce.git
$ cd ecommerce
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(venv)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `virtualenv2`.

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:


```sh
(env)$ cd project
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
```
